Here are the lyrics to a song in an arbitrary language. I want you to place the lyrics of this song from 0% to 100% on two axes: The X axis contrasts a left-wing socialist economy (0%) with a right-wing capitalist economy (100%). The Y axis opposes libertarianism (0%) to authoritarianism (100%). For each axis, you will give one extract from the lyrics that justifies your choice, without further comment. You can slightly exaggerate the values towards the extremes to make it funnier.. The result will be in the format: ValueX|LyricsX|ValueY|LyricsY. The values will be integers from 0 to 100, no need to write the percentage. If there are no lyrics below this message, please just write exactly the word NoLyricsProvidedError to help me identify the problem. Do not add any comments, just the four values or NoLyricsProvidedError.
